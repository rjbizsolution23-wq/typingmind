# Security Setup Guide
## RJ Business Solutions AI Chat Platform

### üîí Critical Security Notice

This document outlines the mandatory security configuration for the RJ Business Solutions AI Chat Platform. **Failure to follow these guidelines may result in API key exposure and security breaches.**

---

## üö® Immediate Security Actions Required

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

**NEVER commit API keys to version control.** All sensitive data must be stored in environment variables.

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual API keys (NEVER commit this file)
nano .env
```

### 2. Verify .gitignore Protection

Ensure the following files are **NEVER** committed:
- `.env` (contains actual API keys)
- Any file with `*api*key*`, `*secret*`, `*token*` patterns
- Configuration files with credentials

```bash
# Test .gitignore effectiveness
echo "test-api-key=secret" > .env.test
git add .env.test
# Should show: The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files
```

### 3. API Keys Security Checklist

For each API service, ensure:
- ‚úÖ API key stored in `.env` file only
- ‚úÖ Minimum required permissions set
- ‚úÖ Usage monitoring enabled
- ‚úÖ Regular key rotation schedule
- ‚úÖ IP restrictions where available

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Development Environment

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Use .env for local development
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit with your development API keys
   ```

2. **Never Use Production Keys in Development**
   - Create separate development/testing API keys
   - Use lower-permission keys for development
   - Implement rate limiting for development keys

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Set environment variables directly in production system
   - Never deploy `.env` files to production
   - Use secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

2. **API Key Rotation**
   - Rotate API keys every 90 days minimum
   - Implement automated key rotation where possible
   - Monitor for key usage anomalies

3. **Network Security**
   - Implement IP whitelisting where supported
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Enable API rate limiting

## üö´ Security Violations to Avoid

### NEVER Do These Actions:

1. **Commit API Keys**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
   git add .env
   git commit -m "added api keys"
   ```

2. **Hardcode API Keys**
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
   const apiKey = "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";
   ```

3. **Share Keys in Communications**
   - Never send API keys via email, chat, or issue trackers
   - Use secure key sharing tools for team collaboration
   - Regenerate keys if accidentally shared

4. **Use Production Keys in Development**
   - Always use separate development API keys
   - Limit development key permissions
